# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to think about contributing! Below are a few guidelines that you will find for contributing to projects.

## Finding Bugs
If you find a bug in the code. Please make sure that the bug was not first seen in any of the other project issues and open a new issue if it has not be spotted yet. Please include relevant information about your computing environment such as operating system and version of important software such as python. If you end up finding a patch for the bug, please open a pull request with a clear title such as **fixes issue #6**. Please try to observe the coding convention set forth in the project and make your code fit that.

## Would you like to test the code?
If you'd like to test the code and find that it breaks, it would be awesome if you wanted to open an issue (Provided the issue you're looking to create is not already there) and list your development environment. Even with the high availability of VMs and linux distro hopping that all the young kids are doing nowadays, it may still be difficult to test on every possible combination of software and hardware out there.

## Thanks!
Not only is contributing really helpful to the maintainers of the project but it also gives you the satisfaction that you've contributed to something that could be big (You'll also get those green squares on your contribution chart).
